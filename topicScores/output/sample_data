	"I say work through it. I heard something once that was to the air of ""it's not if you fight it's how you fight"" basically if you two can talk about it and come to a mutual understanding or some type of compromise you are better off.

	Im sorry to hear about the ending of the relationship and the fallout emotionally. Depression and that feeling of like you said wanting to crawl back into bed and never get out is the worst. But i just want to say that you trying to keep your head above water is awesome to know.
